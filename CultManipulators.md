# Name #

Manipulators

# Short Description #

Powerful magicians who wish to enslave humanity.

# Long Description #

For centuries, men in power have desired the ability to make their subjects obey their every whim. Some have used force, or fear, but none have been completely successful. A group of powerful male magicians, many of whom control powerful multinational corporations, are determined to succeed where others have failed.  Through the use of mind-manipulation magic, memetic manipulation, and subtle influence in world governments, they plan to make every other man, woman, and child on the planet their slaves, forced into fulfilling the Manipulators' dark desires.


# Ritual Start #

The Manipulators start their ultimate ritual with a slow but insidious assault on the psyches of the world, using traditional advertising techniques combined with subtle dark magics.  Much of their work is couched in the comforting form of mass media, convincing people that the
old inhibited days are over, that a new dawn of peace, prosperity, and happiness is on the horizon, subtly hinting that a chosen few will be the ones to lead humanity into the new golden age.  Many are skeptical, but many more are taken in by the Manipulators' careful schemes, as the magics work their way on the minds of the converted and unconverted alike.

# Ritual Success #

The Manipulators' control of the world becomes more and more overt, their supposedly-benign stewardship turning into outright worship by the masses. Their magics turn support into adulation, appreciation into unfettered desire; the world wants, needs to fulfill their every whim, no matter the consequence. People of all genders and ages disappear into the gleaming palaces, their bodies and minds used for unmentionable new rituals. The diversity of humanity is now nothing more than a living, breathing mass of clay for the Manipulators to sculpt as they desire. And their desires are manifold indeed.

# Ritual Failure #

What at first seemed like the genuine rise of a new era of freedom and prosperity turns sour, many of its proponents discovered to be frauds and freaks.  The Manipulators themselves stay behind the scenes, protected by layers of misdirection and human shields, but the effects
of their manipulations begin to fade.  People once again assert contrary views with candor; for a moment, they view the mass media with a genuine critical eye.  Then the time passes, advertisements and packaged views reasserting their mundane control on the opinions, just another day in this modern life.

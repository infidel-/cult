#summary DEV release changes from latest version

 * AI cheat: investigators will cap starting willpower :)
 * much lower chance of investigator killing cult origin
 * automatically un-paralyze cult after 3 turns even if it has no priests (you can still win the game when all enemy cults are paralyzed at the same time)
 * when un-paralyzed, a new origin will be made a temporary generator (stops being a generator when lost)
 * investigator will now disappear after destroying the cult origin thinking he destroyed the whole cult :)
 * bug: when searching for a node to be a sect leader, was not using the most connected node
 * bug: node visibility for enemy cult was not correctly updated on losing that node

 * advanced map mode (toggled by pressing A)
 * when cult loses origin remove investigator only if no priests are available
 * bug: map display was not updated after sect creation

 * all node images combined into one
 * leave "close" button in the main menu after finishing game
 * new bitmap font for advanced map mode, courtesy of qubodup
 * music player display tweaked
 * new sects are now automatically created at the start of player's turn, button "Create sect" removed
 * AI director implemented, will try to give some virgins to the weakest cult and double generators output sometimes (to get debug info about all director actions, open debug menu and select Trace Director toggle)

Evil Cult is a turn-based strategy of global conquest. You play as the leader of a certain cult whose goal is either to destroy all other cults (there are three of them) or summon Elder God, which is the same. You can try summoning when you have 3 priests and 9 virgins. Chance of success greatly depends on society awareness. Other cults have other goals but the principle is the same - they need priests and virgins of complete it.

At the start of the game you have one follower - a neophyte. As this neophyte is the Origin of your cult, each turn he generates a point of one of the three resources - Intimidation, Persuasion or Bribery. You will need these resources to gain more followers or to convert the followers of other cults. You can convert resources between themselves at the ratio 2 to 1. 
There is also a fourth resource - virgins. You can convert virgins to any other resource at the ratio 1 to 1. 

*Nodes*: The squares with letters on a map screen are people - your potential followers. Letter stands for the resource you need to gain that follower. In the case of follower already belonging to some cult there will be a number instead showing level of that follower. Of course the higher the level the harder it is to convert that follower to your cult. Moving the mouse cursor over a square (I will call them nodes from now on) will show a tooltip with information about that node. Pick a square that needs a resource which you have and click on it. That action will trigger an attempt to gain a follower. The chance of success is displayed in a node tooltip. If you do not have resources which are needed to gain any nodes around you, do not worry. End your turn and convert resources to the one you need. 

*Generators*: If you see a node with a more wider border line this is a generator node - when you gain this follower he will generate a point of some resource each turn. Follower node is harder to gain then the common one but it is worth it. Keep in mind that if society awareness is high you can fail to get some of the new resources on next turn. Small numbers "+0-1" under the current resource amount in status panel show how much of that resource you will get on the next turn. Generators are a valued possession of any cult so they are in need of protection. If a generator node is connected to 3 or more nodes it becomes protected - no cult can try to convert this node without first converting nodes around it so that number of connections is lower then 3.

*Followers*: Your followers can be one of three levels - neophytes, adepts and priests. To upgrade a follower you will need virgins equal to the follower level and 3 followers of that level. Neophytes can gather virgins - that's why you need to convert people to your followers. Adepts can lower society awareness of your cult. And priests are needed for the ritual of summoning.

*Awareness*: Society awareness is a very important stat of your cult. The higher it is the harder it is to do anything - be it gain a follower, perform a ritual or gain a resource. You will notice the effects of high awareness when you will start failing to gain new followers. In that case you will need to lower it using your adepts. Of course you need to have some adepts first. Adepts lower awareness using any of available resources except virgins. But they are not superhuman so each adept can only use one resource point to lower awareness.

All rules described here also apply to other cults. So you can suddenly find out that another cult completed their goal and took over the world.

      { name: "Cult of Elder God",
        note: "The cult still lives.",
        longNote: "At the dawn of humanity the great old ones tolds their secrets in dreams to the first men, who formed a cult which had never died... Hidden in distant and dark places of the world, waiting for the day when the stars will be right again and the mighty Elder God will rise from his slumber under the deep waters to bring the earth beneath his sway once more.",

      { name: "Pharaonic Slumber",
        note: "A group that wants to put the entire world to sleep, feeding on the nightmares of the dreamers.",
        longNote: "Abhumans from a dark dimension close to ours came to Earth thousands of years ago, trading their magics and technology with the Egyptians for control of their people's minds when they slept, for they fed upon nightmares. With the secret help of the Roman Empire, the Egyptians drove the abhumans into hiding. But they have returned, and their goal has grown with time: the permanent slumber of the world.",
        summonStart: "As the Pharaonic Slumber's power grows, the world enters a state of controlled drowsiness. People go to bed earlier and sleep later, their dreams plagued with thoughts of sweeping sands and dark figures. Short naps at work become almost commonplace, and as the abhumans feed upon the dreaming energies of the world, everyone feels less and less energetic. All the more reason to take a bit of a rest...",
        summonFinish: "The world drifts off to sleep, some even slumping to the sidewalk where they were just walking or barely managing to bring their vehicles to a stop. The abhumans come out in force, walking amongst the dreaming populace, feeding hungrily upon the horrid dreams foisted upon them by the dark magics. A few humans manage to keep themselves awake a bit longer on massive doses of amphetamines, but soon they too crash into the darkness of eternal slumber, screaming into unconsciousness as they see the burning red eyes of those who've come to consume their thoughts.",
        summonFail: "People shake off the dozing state that had captured them. Sales of coffee and cola rocket temporarily, an odd spike that intrigues many commentators, and for a moment humanity is more awake than it has ever been before. Soon, however, old habits return, and some are still plagued by dreams of windswept deserts they have never before seen and cloaked figures that move in a way that somehow feels inhuman, dreams that feel more real than reality." },

      { name: "Blooded Mask",
        note: "A group devoted to ripping away the masks people wear and revealing the insane reality beyond.",
        longNote: "Those who peer too long into the Abyss find that it stares back at them, and the Blooded Mask has long gazed into the ineffable world beyond our own. Affiliated with no Elder God, or perhaps all of them, the Blooded Mask longs to show humanity the brutal truths that hide behind the consensual reality. The truths drive those who see them insane, filling them with a desire to show others as well, and the Blooded Mask are the original converts.",
        summonStart: "A rash of cases of schizophrenia and paranoid delusions becomes an epidemic.  World health organizations struggle to understand environmental factors behind the increasing numbers of psychotic breaks and irrational behaviour across the world, unaware of the rituals the Blooded Mask are enacting.  The only clue is an increased incidence of individuals trying to claw their eyes out, often babbling about seeing <i>the truth</i> better without them.",
        summonFinish: "Even the most stable individuals become gripped by the desire to see beyond the veil. Plucking their eyes out, almost as one, humanity peers out of bloody sockets into the screaming void of alien truth that had, until then, been hidden to most. The Bloody Veil's incantations brought to their climax, the world becomes a madhouse of screaming blind horror, people stumbling through living nightmares in colours their minds were never meant to comprehend, groping past those others wandering in the same strange geometries.",
        summonFail: "The outbreak of madness draws to a close, the circumstances at its end as mysterious as when it began. Sanity returns to some of those who saw the underlying truth, but those who blinded themselves are relegated to sanitariums around the world, their screaming reverberating in the halls of the buildings, unable to stop seeing the horrifying ur-reality. A small number of painters attempt to incorporate the colours they saw in their madness into their work, and the epileptic seizures their paintings evoke cause the black ops divisions of the world's governments to destroy all evidence of their work." },

      { name: "Universal Lambda",
        note: "Programmers who want to turn humanity into a vast processing machine.",
        longNote: "In the early seventies, a secret goverment project uncovered the changes necessary to turn any human brain into an efficient, soulless computer.  Little did the project know that it had been subverted by the dark cult. The Universal Lambda works to refine that now-defunct project's results: the turning of every human being into cogs of a huge machine, a distributed network for the vast living intellect of the Elder God.",
        summonStart: "The Universal Lambda's cybermantic machinations begin to influence the entire world.  People start to walk in unconscious lockstep down the streets; crime and accident rates drop as the rituals rewire minds to be more and more regimented.  People make fewer choices, locking themselves into patterns without realizing the steady loss of free will.",
        summonFinish: "Their rituals complete, the Universal Lambda turns the world into a well-oiled machine. Bodies still move around, taking part in the same rote behavior they did before, but the minds of the populace are gone. Instead of thinking independent thoughts, humanity's brains run the code that allows The Machine to run in our dimension. The tiny flickers of free will brought upon by every birth are quickly consumed by the overwhelming cybermantic magics enveloping the world; all are just parts of the giant soulless entity... ",
        summonFail: "The eerily constant behavior of humanity slowly returns to its regular froth of chaos. People still occasionally slip into the robotic state they exhibited mere days before, but the rising rate of accidents and deaths heralds the return of free will, for better or worse." }
